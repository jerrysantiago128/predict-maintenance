| FR-1    | The system shall collect sensor data (temperature, vibration, battery) from each robot every 1 minute. |
| FR-2    | The system shall process and analyze sensor data in real-time (within 5 seconds of collection).        |
| FR-3    | The system shall detect anomalies based on pre-defined thresholds (e.g., temperature > X°C).           |
| FR-4    | The system shall trigger an alert when a potential failure is detected.                                |
| FR-5    | The system shall display robot health status and active alerts on a dashboard.                         |
| FR-6    | The system shall allow maintenance staff to acknowledge and dismiss resolved alerts.                   |
| FR-7    | The system shall store alert logs for later review and analysis.                                       |
| FR-8    | The system shall simulate behavior using sample data (e.g., Google Sheets or Python script).           |

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

| Category         | Requirement                                                                     |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Performance      | The system shall process and analyze sensor data with <5-second delay.          |
| Reliability      | The system shall maintain 99.9% uptime during monitoring hours.                 |
| Usability        | The dashboard UI shall be intuitive and require minimal training.               |
| Scalability      | The system shall be capable of supporting up to 100 robots simultaneously.      |
| Security         | The system shall restrict dashboard access to authorized maintenance personnel. |
| Maintainability  | The system architecture shall allow for easy updates to thresholds and rules.   |

## 3️⃣ User Stories / Use Cases

### User Stories

- **As a** maintenance technician,  
  **I want** to receive real-time alerts about robot failures,  
  **so that** I can address issues before they cause downtime.

- **As a** warehouse manager,  
  **I want** to monitor the overall health status of all robots on a dashboard,  
  **so that** I can plan maintenance activities proactively.

- **As a** software engineer,  
  **I want** to test the system using simulated data,  
  **so that** we can validate alert logic without requiring live robots.
