# Project Charter

## Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to design a **Predictive Maintenance (PdM) system** for RoboTrack Systems, enabling early detection of robot failures in automated warehouses. The PdM system will collect and analyze IoT sensor data (temperature, vibration, battery levels) to prevent unexpected downtime and optimize maintenance schedules.

---

## High-Level Scope

This project will focus on:
- Designing a PdM system for robot health monitoring.
- Developing system architecture and a dashboard mockup.
- Simulating core functionality with sample data.
- Delivering requirements documentation and risk assessment.

## Business Case / Justification

**Current Problem**:
RoboTrackâ€™s automated warehouses experience disruptions due to unexpected robot failures, impacting productivity and increasing costs.

**Proposed Solution**:
A PdM system that leverages IoT sensor data to proactively identify risks and generate alerts. This approach will:
- Minimize unplanned downtime.
- Reduce emergency maintenance costs.
- Enhance warehouse operational efficiency.

## High-Level Risks and Assumptions

### Risks
- **Sensor failures** leading to inaccurate or missing data.
- **False positives/negatives** in predictive algorithms.
- **Limited stakeholder availability** delaying feedback.

### Assumptions
- Robots have functional sensors and data collection capabilities.
- Stakeholders are available for requirements validation.
- Historical sensor data patterns correlate with failure risks.
