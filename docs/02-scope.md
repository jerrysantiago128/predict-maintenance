# Project Scope

## Project Objectives and Deliverables

### Objectives
- Design a **Predictive Maintenance (PdM) system** for RoboTrack Systems to proactively detect robot failures in warehouses using sensor data.
- Minimize unplanned downtime and maintenance costs through early risk identification.

### Deliverables
- A **system architecture diagram** showing data flow from sensors to analysis and alerting.
- A **dashboard mockup** with alert panels and robot status.
- **Preliminary requirements documentation** (functional & non-functional).
- A **risk assessment** outlining potential project and technical risks.
- A **simulation/prototype** demonstrating basic alert functionality.

## Constraints (Time, Budget, Resources)

- **Time**: Estimated **14 day** project timeline.
- **Budget**: Limited to internal resource allocation; no external funding or hardware purchases.
- **Resources**: Solo software engineering consultant; simulated data only (no access to physical robots).

---

## Assumptions

- All warehouse robots are equipped with functional IoT sensors.
- Sensor data can be collected at 1-minute intervals and used for predictive analytics.
- Stakeholders will provide timely feedback during design and validation phases.
- Predictive models can identify early failure risks with reasonable accuracy using threshold-based detection.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- A complete **system architecture diagram** is delivered and reviewed.
- The **dashboard mockup** contains at least one screen with robot status and alerts.
- A **requirements document** outlines core system functionality.
- A **simulation or prototype** demonstrates basic alert triggering from sensor data.
- A **risk assessment** document outlines at least three risks with mitigation strategies.
