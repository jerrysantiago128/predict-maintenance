# Business Considerations & Risk

This document outlines the key business considerations, anticipated benefits, potential risks, and fallback plans for the Predictive Maintenance (PdM) system designed for RoboTrack Systems’ warehouse robots.

## Benefits

- **Reduce Unplanned Downtime**  
  - By continuously monitoring motor temperature, vibration, and battery health, the PdM system can identify early warning signs of failure.  
  - Alerts are generated before a component reaches a critical state, allowing maintenance teams to intervene proactively instead of reacting to breakdowns.  
  - Result: Fewer emergency repairs, improved throughput, and reduced disruption to warehouse operations.

- **Optimize Maintenance Scheduling**  
  - Maintenance activities are scheduled based on actual usage trends and sensor-driven indications rather than fixed intervals.  
  - For example, if a robot’s battery health remains within acceptable thresholds, its replacement or service can be safely deferred, freeing resources for higher-priority tasks.  
  - Result: Lower maintenance costs (fewer unnecessary part replacements), extended component lifespans, and more efficient resource allocation.

## Risks

- **Sensor Failure**  
  - If a temperature, vibration, or battery sensor malfunctions, the system may receive incomplete or incorrect data.  
  - Consequence: Anomalies could go undetected (missed failure) or false alarms could be triggered (unnecessary maintenance).  
  - Probability & Impact: Medium likelihood—sensors in industrial environments can be affected by dust, moisture, or mechanical shock; high impact due to reliance on accurate readings.

- **False Positives / Negatives**  
  - **False Positives**: Normal fluctuations in metrics might be misinterpreted as anomalies (e.g., brief temperature spikes during startup).  
    - Consequence: Maintenance team receives unnecessary alerts, leading to “alert fatigue” and wasted labor hours.  
  - **False Negatives**: Subtle trends that precede failure may not exceed configured thresholds early enough.  
    - Consequence: A failure occurs despite monitoring, resulting in unexpected downtime.  
  - Probability & Impact: Medium likelihood—threshold tuning and pattern‐recognition algorithms may require adjustment; high impact because both false positives and negatives undermine confidence in the PdM solution.

## Fallback Plans

1. **Manual Overrides**  
   - **Description**: Allow maintenance staff to manually flag a robot as “requires service” or “do not disturb” regardless of automated alerts.  
   - **When to Use**:  
     - If a sensor is known to be unreliable (e.g., undergoing recalibration), the maintenance team can suppress alerts temporarily.  
     - If a technician identifies a latent mechanical issue during routine inspection (even if sensor trends are within thresholds), they can override the automated decision.  
   - **Implementation Notes**:  
     - The dashboard UI includes a “Manual Service Request” button on each robot’s status card.  
     - Overridden robots are logged separately so that the PdM system can continue logging raw data without generating redundant notifications.

2. **Redundant Data Checks**  
   - **Description**: Implement cross‐validation rules that compare multiple data sources or metrics to confirm an anomaly before issuing an alert.  
   - **Examples**:  
     - If motor temperature exceeds threshold _X_ °C **and** vibration amplitude exceeds threshold _Y mm/s within the same time window, then generate an alert; otherwise, treat as a transient spike.  
     - Periodically compare sensor readings to historical averages or moving‐window baselines to identify sensor drift (i.e., if a sensor’s readings deviate from expected patterns by a fixed percentage, flag the sensor for maintenance rather than the robot).  
   - **Implementation Notes**:  
     - Analysis Engine pipelines include “sanity checks” that discard obviously faulty readings (e.g., sudden drops to zero or values outside the physical capabilities of the robot).  
     - If a single sensor’s data conflicts with correlating metrics (e.g., battery voltage appears normal, but vibration is extremely high), the system generates a “Sensor Health” alert and prioritizes sensor inspection.  
     - Store raw and validated data in separate tables so that if validation logic changes, historical data can be reprocessed without data loss.

### Summary

By carefully weighing these benefits, risks, and fallback plans, RoboTrack Systems can confidently proceed with the PdM implementation. The **fallback mechanisms** (manual overrides and redundant checks) ensure that the system remains reliable even in cases of sensor malfunction or ambiguous readings, while the **business benefits** (reduced downtime and optimized maintenance) justify the investment and operational adjustments required to adopt predictive maintenance.
