# Project Overview

## Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to design a **Predictive Maintenance (PdM) system** for RoboTrack Systems, enabling early detection of robot failures in automated warehouses. The PdM system will collect and analyze IoT sensor data (temperature, vibration, battery levels) to prevent unexpected downtime and optimize maintenance schedules.

---

**Current Problem**:
RoboTrackâ€™s automated warehouses experience disruptions due to unexpected robot failures, impacting productivity and increasing costs.

---

## System Goal
A PdM system that leverages IoT sensor data to proactively identify risks and generate alerts. This approach will:
- Minimize unplanned downtime.
- Reduce emergency maintenance costs.
- Enhance warehouse operational efficiency.

---


## Key Assumptions
- Robots have functional sensors and network connectivity.
- Each robot has (3) sensors. One for temperature, battery level, and vibration.
- Historical sensor data patterns correlate with failure risks for future failure prediction.
