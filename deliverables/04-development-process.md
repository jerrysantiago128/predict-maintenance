# Section 4: Development Process

## Chosen Process Model: Agile (Scrum)

**Why Chosen**: I picked Agile because it's flexible and good for software projects. Since we're dealing with IoT sensors and data analysis, we might need to make changes as we go. This allows us to get feedback from the system quickly and adjust if something isn't working right. Also, we can deliver working parts of the system incrementally instead of waiting until the end.

The main benefits:
* Test features early
* Client(s) can see progress regularly 
* Easy to make changes if requirements shift
* Less risky than waterfall approach

## High-Level Development Plan

### **Phase 1: Planning and Setup**
**Time**: 2-3 weeks
* Meet with Stakeholders to understand their current problems
* Figure out what sensors we need and how often to collect data
* Design the basic system architecture
* Set up development tools and environment
* Create initial project backlog

### **Phase 2: Data Collection System**  
**Time**: 3-4 weeks
* Build the part that gets data from robot sensors
* Create database to store all the sensor readings
* Make sure data is coming in correctly
* Test with some sample robot data
* Basic data validation to catch bad readings

### **Phase 3: Analysis and Alerts**
**Time**: 4-5 weeks  
* Develop algorithms to detect when robots might fail
* Create alert system to notify maintenance team
* Build simple dashboard to show robot status
* Test different threshold settings
* Make sure alerts aren't too frequent (false positives)

### **Phase 4: User Interface and Integration**
**Time**: 3-4 weeks
* Build main dashboard for maintenance staff
* Add mobile notifications for urgent alerts  
* Connect with RoboTrack's existing systems
* User testing and feedback collection
* Fix any usability issues

### **Phase 5: Testing and Deployment**
**Time**: 2-3 weeks
* System and Security Testing
* Performance testing with lots of data
* Deploy to production environment
* Train users and create documentation

### Miscellanous Considerations:
**Project Management:**
- Requirements might change as we learn more
- Integration with existing systems could be tricky
- Timeline pressure from client

**Mitigation:**
- Regular communication with stakeholders
- Build integration early in the process
- Focus on core features first, nice-to-haves later
